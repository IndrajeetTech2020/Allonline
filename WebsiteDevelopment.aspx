                                    <p>Almost everyone has a mobile telephone these days. Payment by SMS is a low threshold method of payment. A product or service may be paid for simply by sending or receiving a text message. This method of payment is ideal for so called ‘micro-payments’, and for offering an alternative payment method to target groups who do not have a credit card or their own bank account.</p>

                                    <p>Paying by online is an interesting method of payment if you offer digital products or services at a low price, since this method is suitable for so-called ‘micro-payments’. Other handy benefits for consumers are that payments by online gateway are anonymous, fast and easy. This makes it a low threshold method of payment. Also handy for you as a merchant as you can see immediately when a payment has been made.</p>

                                    <p>If you’re involved with integration, you have to be well-versed with application program interfaces (APIs), which are tools that make it possible to manage software applications. While invisible to end users, APIs are essential for communication between programs.</p>
                                    <p>Social media networking giants Facebook and Twitter are just a couple of companies that have made good use of open or public APIs. Basically, an open API is one in which an organization publishes its software to be shared freely. A startup, for example, may want to open its API, as doing so encourages third parties to use its software.</p>
                                    <p>This guide brings together a range of stories that highlight examples of successful API management, trends with the technology and key terms developers need to know.</p>
